short_desc: "AI has immense potential to support Blind and Low Vision people access visual information. In fact, SeeingAI and similar applications have been around for almost a decade generating visual descriptions on the fly. Anecdotally, these apps had a huge impact on the independence of Blind and Low Vision people. But... is this truly the case? In this paper we present a thorough analysis of hundreds of user interactions with a scene description application to explain: \n Why do Blind and Low Vision people use applications like SeeingAI? \n How useful are they?
