short_desc: "We implemented four leading approaches to facilitating spatial awareness for gamers with visual impairments and investigate their merits and limitations. The four tools are: a smartphone map, a whole-room shockwave, a directional scanner, and a simple audio menu of points-of-interest. We evaluated how important gamers consider six different types of spatial awareness â€” that have been found to be important in physical world settings. Our findings reveal important design implications for future spatial awareness tools "
