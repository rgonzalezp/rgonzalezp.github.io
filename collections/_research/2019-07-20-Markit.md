# Markit, a Blender Add-on to Augment 3D Models

Authors: Lei Shi, and ***Ricardo E. Gonzalez***

Markit is an add-on to Blender, a popular 3D modeling application among 3D model designers. It provides step-by-step guidance for creating augmented models for non-experts. After importing a downloaded model into Markit, a maker can add the tracker scaffold and associate textual annotations with elements on the model. With the model annotated, we can explore the annotations through [Talkit++](link).

Markit enables non-expert users to be able to create their own 3D printed augmented models without necessarily knowing all the steps involved with creating 3D models. They can easily reuse pre-existing models in Markit available on popular online repositories of 3D models like [Thingiverse](link), [site2](link), and many others!
