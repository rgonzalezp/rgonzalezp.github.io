<p>Markit is an add-on to Blender, a popular 3D modeling application among 3D model designers. It provides step-by-step guidance for creating augmented models for non-experts. After importing a downloaded model into Markit, a maker can add the tracker scaffold and associate textual annotations with elements on the model. With the model annotated, we can explore the annotations through <a href="link">Talkit++</a>.</p>

<p>Markit enables non-expert users to be able to create their own 3D printed augmented models without necessarily knowing all the steps involved with creating 3D models. They can easily reuse pre-existing models in Markit available on popular online repositories of 3D models like <a href="link">Thingiverse</a>, <a href="link">site2</a>, and many others!</p>
