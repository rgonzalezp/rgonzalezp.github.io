<p>Virtual reality (VR) uses three main senses to relay information: sight, sound, and touch. People with visual impairments (PVI) rely primarily on sound and haptic feedback (touch) to receive information about VR environments. While researchers have explored several approaches to make navigation and perception of objects more accessible in VR, none of them offer a natural way to request descriptions of objects, nor control of the flow of auditory information.</p>

<p>To address this gap, we designed a set of hand gestures that
PVI can perform to request descriptions about the environment.</p>

<p>We designed a VR haptic glove based on the open-source project
LucidVR [10]. These gloves are capable of tracking the user’s finger curling, detecting hand movements in VR, and providing FFB
through the user’s fingers.</p>

<p>Informed by the gloves capabilities and previous work (e.g., See-
ingVR, VizWiz, Seeing AI, OrCam) [ 1– 3, 20 ], we designed a series
of hand gestures that can be performed to trigger the descriptions
interactively. These gestures allow the user to obtain information
about the environment, and also dynamically control the speech
rate of the voice reader.</p>
